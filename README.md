### __The line-by-line Program__

1line is a shell program written in Python **completely FOSS**. It's main objective is to make simple note-taking faster and more convenient without forcing you to start up an application.



## Installation:
```
pip3 install pyinstaller
```
Go to the directory that contains "1line.py"
```
pyinstaller --onefile 1line.py
```
Your unix-executable file is in the "dist" folder



## Usage:
```
$ 1line

$ 1line list

$ 1line add social-studies
> exit

$ 1line biology
> the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
> exit

$ 1line remove social-studies

$ 1line open

$ 1line open biology
```

Have fun with it, and contribute if you wish!
